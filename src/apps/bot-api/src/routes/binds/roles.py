        """Handle the /binds/roles/ endpoint.

        Determines what roles a user should have based on the bindings that
        apply to them.

        Restricted users will always result in the unverified role(s) being
        returned.

        The payload of the request should contain:
        - The guild ID
        - A list of the user's current roles (IDs only)
        - The roles to be given & removed based on the user's bindings

        Example payload:
        {
            "guild_id": "1234567",
            "user_roles": ["12345"],
            "successful_binds": {"give": ["1234"], "remove": ["12344"]},
        }

        Based on the output from /binds/<user_id>, the Unverified & Verified role IDs will
        already be included in the successful_binds section, along with the entire group binds.

        Likewise, restricted logic should have already been handled prior, so the unverified role is expected
        to be the only binding to give.

        Returns:
            A JSON payload that determines if the request was successful or not, and what roles
            were added, which were removed, and the resulting role list.

            Example successful response:
            {
                "success": true
                "final_roles": ["123456", "12346782134698"],
                "added_roles": ["123456"],
                "removed_roles": ["123487578"],
            }

            Example failure response:
            {
                "success": false
                "reason": (str),
